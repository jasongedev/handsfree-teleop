# Hands-free Teleoperation of a Dual-Arm Robot via Real-time 3D Pose Estimation


Docs and build instructions being updated. Discussion of implementation also to come. Check back on Monday!

# Overview

This package is a proof of concept for using ROS and MoveIt to control two robot arms in real-time that mirror human poses captured through a monocular camera feed.
