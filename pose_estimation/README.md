# 3D Pose Estimation Model

The pre-trained model and a significant portion of the inference code in this folder came from the [Open Model Zoo](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/open_model_zoo) repository, which in turn was based on the [Lightweight OpenPose](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.12004.pdf) and [Single-Shot Multi-Person 3D Pose Estimation From Monocular RGB](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.03453.pdf) papers.

I retained only the portions neccesary for GPU inference. Most of my original work was performed in the AngleCalculator class.
